<b>Key Point: </b>
Here the main thing is to know that padding is set to <b>10px 2%</b>
padding: 10px 2% ensures dynamic spacing across screen sizes.

### 2.Creating Sidebar

Here is the Folder for [Sidebar](src/Components/Sidebar)

i) Added all icons and text behind it<br>
ii) Added css as displaying flex and margins to look responsive<br>
iii) The main in css of sidebar is <b>overflow-y: auto; </b> which adds a vertical line upto your sidebar

## Here Comes the Props in SideBar (Whenever user clicks on menu icon the side bar should minimize)

Here is the [App.jsx File](App.jsx)
<br> 
In this we have used the useState----> Which is of boolean type because it is easy to toggle
<br>
Props are sent in the Navbar(state variable)
<br> And in the Home(state method)
<br>
<br> ----> In Navbar whenever the menu icon is clicked it toggles between true and false ,if true the sidebar minimizes else maximizes
<br>
<br>
----> In Home we sent the usestate method,as variable changes then the feed(video cards) changes.
<br>

<b>Key Point: </b>Props and state (useState) control sidebar visibility, demonstrating Reactâ€™s one-way data flow.

### 3.Creating VideoCards As Feeds
Here is the Folder for [Feed](src/Components/Feed)
<br>
The Feed component displays a grid of video cards that act as feeds, similar to the YouTube homepage.
<br>
Displays multiple video cards with:
<br>

o Thumbnail image

o Video title

o Channel name

o View count and upload time

Built with a responsive grid layout using CSS.

#### How it works:

o Thumbnail images are imported from the assets folder.

o Each card contains static content (can be made dynamic in future).

o Responsive design allows cards to adjust on different screen sizes.

<b>Key Point: </b>
The Feed component dynamically renders multiple VideoCard components.
